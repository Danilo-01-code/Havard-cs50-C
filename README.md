# CS50 C Exercises Repository

Welcome to my CS50 C exercises repository. This repository contains various exercises, task configurations, and supplementary files related to the CS50 course.



## About

This repository is dedicated to exercises and projects from the CS50 course, which is a popular introduction to computer science offered by Harvard University. The exercises are written in C, covering a wide range of topics from the course.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **exercises/**: Contains the individual exercise files.
- **task.json**: Configuration file for tasks.
- **s_spp_propriets/**: Supplementary files and properties used for the exercises.

## Exercises

Each exercise in the `exercises` directory is designed to reinforce a specific concept taught in the CS50 course. The exercises cover a range of topics, including:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers and memory management
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, etc.)

## Task Configuration

The `task.json` file contains configurations related to the tasks and exercises. It includes metadata and settings that help in managing and executing the exercises efficiently.

## Supplementary Files

The `s_spp_propriets` directory contains supplementary files and properties that support the exercises. These may include additional resources, libraries, or configuration files needed for certain tasks.
